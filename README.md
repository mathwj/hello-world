# hello-world

Hello,

For those who want to know a little about me,

I direct the knowledge I acquire from  experiences and studies in order to improve my intellectual, physical, emotional, character, social and spiritual being. Always seeking to refine that my method is being applied in: personal and professional. And this is how I justify my objective passions. Mathematics brings me the 'order of life', its accuracy brings us 'reason' whhich is my greatest fascination towards this science. Math uses is functional, it doesn't lie, lie who makes misuse. And Scouting as the essence of life, connects us with the sensitive and intelligible. It is characterized as an esphera which lands all the gnosis for life, in your personal and professional relationships.
